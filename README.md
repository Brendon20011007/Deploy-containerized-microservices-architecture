# Microservices Architecture on AWS EKS - Project Summary

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a modern, scalable microservices architecture on AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). The infrastructure is designed to be production-ready, with a focus on scalability, observability, and maintainability.

## Infrastructure Components

### Core Infrastructure
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: AWS EKS with Fargate
  - Serverless container runtime
  - No EC2 instance management required
  - Automatic scaling and updates

- **Networking**:
  - VPC with public and private subnets
  - NAT Gateway for private subnet connectivity
  - Internet Gateway for public access
  - Security groups and network policies

### Microservices Architecture
- **Service Components**:
  - User Management Service
  - Order Processing Service
  - Payment Service
  - Each service runs in isolated namespaces

- **Service Mesh**:
  - AWS App Mesh implementation
  - Service-to-service communication
  - Traffic management and routing
  - Observability and monitoring

### Load Balancing & Scaling
- **Load Balancing**:
  - AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)
  - Ingress Controller for Kubernetes
  - SSL/TLS termination

- **Auto Scaling**:
  - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
  - Dynamic resource allocation
  - CPU-based scaling triggers

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Monitoring Stack**:
  - Prometheus for metrics collection
  - Grafana for visualization
  - AWS CloudWatch integration
  - Container insights
